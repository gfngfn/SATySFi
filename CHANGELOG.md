### Added
- Begins to support Markdown inputs.
- Supports PDF hyperlinks ([PR\#113](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/113) by `matsud224`).
- Supports fixed-length list patterns ([PR\#123](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/123) by `nekketsuuu`).
- Supports PDF outlines ([PR\#134](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/134) by `matsud224`).
- Reports detailed error messages when a given image file is invalid ([PR\#138](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/138) by `matsud224`).
- Provides new primitives `get-leftmost-script : inline-boxes -> script option`, `get-rightmost-script : inline-boxes -> script option`, and `script-guard-both : script -> script -> inline-boxes -> inline-boxes`.
- Regards `<LIBROOT>/local/packages/` as a place for user-defined packages.
- Uses `<LIBROOT>/local/hash/fonts.satysfi-hash` (as well as `<LIBROOT>/dist/fonts.satysfi-hash`) for a font fash file (the same holds for `<LIBROOT>/local/hash/mathfonts.satysfi-hash`).
- Supports (non-extensible) record updates, i.e., `(| <record> with <label> = <new-value> |)`.
- Supports a MetaML-like two-stage computation performed by *bracket* `& <expr> ` and *escape* `~ <expr>` and equipped with (a somewhat restrictive variant of) cross-stage persistence.
- Uses `"$(pwd)/.satysfi/"` as one of the library roots, and provides option `--config <colon-separated paths>` (or `-C …`) for adding arbitrary paths to the library roots ([PR\#161](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/161) by `nyuichi`).
- Supports the insertion of images by `![…](…)` in Markdown sources ([PR\#139](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/139) by `hikalium`).
- Supports the local import `@import: …` for the text-generating mode (i.e. supports importing `.satyh-*` or `.satyg` files).
- Provides a new primitive `omit-skip-after`.
- Provides new options `--debug-show-block-bbox` and `--debug-show-block-space`.
- Allows `[]` (i.e. the empty list) or `(| |)` (i.e. the empty record) as an expression argument of commands.
- Add new primitive `abort-with-message` (which is equivalent to OCaml’s `failwith`).
- Add new primitives `lift-int`, `lift-string`, etc. for lifting basic values in two-stage computation (which may be, however, replaced with a more general single primitive operation based on *cross-stage persistence*).
- Add the MacroML-like notion of macro based on two-stage programming.
- Supports two-column page break.

### Deprecated
- The use of `"src-dist":` entries in font hash files is deprecated; use `"src":` instead, which requires a font file’s path relative to `<LIBROOT>`. An entry of the form `"src-dist": "<path/to/font-file>"` is now treated equivalently to `"src": "dist/fonts/<path/to/font-file>"`.

## [0.0.3] - 2018-10-09
### Fixed
- Does NOT insert spacing between different scripts when the [line breaking class](http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/) of the posterior charcter is CL, CP, QU, NS, JLCP (= [JLreq cl-02](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/ja/#cl-02)), JLFS (= [JLreq cl-06](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/ja/#cl-06)), or JLCM (= [JLreq cl-07](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/ja/#cl-07)).

### Added
- Supports the application of math commands to optional arguments.
- Provides primitives `set-space-ratio-between-scripts` and `get-space-ratio-between-scripts`.

## [0.0.2] - 2018-08-09
### Fixed
- Make the type inference algorithm firmer (mainly about records and optional arguments).

### Changed
- Conforms to a new operational semantics as to optional arguments.
- Starts reporting errors for duplicated fields in a record expression.
